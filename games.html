                    <h3>GamePlay</h3>
                    <p>Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and consequently retains its team-based
                        objective-oriented
                        first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's
                        objective. There are many types
                        of objectives that a map can have, but the ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than
                        the opposing team, which
                        is accomplished by fulfilling the map's winning conditions. Some winning conditions include
                        defusing a bomb, planting a
                        bomb and preventing it from being defused by the other team, rescuing all the hostages on a map,
                        preventing the hostages
                        from being rescued, and defeat all the members of the opposing team. When playing on a server
                        without modifications, if
                        players are defeated during a round, they do not respawn until the next round, unlike in many
                        other first-person shooter
                        games, where players respawn on a set timer.</p>


                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>Counter-Strike: Source was initially released as a beta to members of the Valve Cyber Caf√©
                        Program on August 11,
                        2004. On August 18, 2004, the beta was released to owners of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero as
                        well as those who
                        had received a Half-Life 2 voucher bundled with some ATI Radeon video cards. The game was
                        included with Half-Life 2
                        bundles, which were released on November 16, 2004.

                        On October 11, 2006, Valve released an experimental update entitled Dynamic Weapons Pricing.
                        Under this system, item
                        prices are determined based on their demand the previous week.

                        On March 5, 2010, Valve announced the release of games from its first-party library, including
                        games from the
                        Counter-Strike series, for Mac OS X. The ports were slated for release in April 2010.[11] Valve
                        employed Hidden Path
                        Entertainment to provide support on updating Counter-Strike: Source. On May 7, 2010, Valve
                        released an update that
                        includes new features and functionality developed in collaboration with Hidden Path
                        Entertainment. These include 144
                        (now 146) new achievements, a new domination and revenge system, similar to that of Team
                        Fortress 2, player stats, an
                        upgrade to the Source engine and more. On June 23, 2010, Valve released the beta to the public
                        alongside the promised OS
                        X version. On February 5, 2013, Valve released a port of Counter-Strike: Source for Linux.</p>

                <section id="Counter-Strike-Global">

                    <h3>GamePlay</h3>
                    <p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based,
                        multiplayer first-person
                        shooter. Two opposing teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to
                        repeatedly complete
                        objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or capturing
                        hostages. At the end
                        of each short round, players are rewarded based on individual and team performance with in-game
                        currency to spend on
                        other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds generally rewards more money than
                        losing does, and
                        completing map-based objectives, including killing enemies, gives additional cash bonuses.</p>



                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the sequel to the popular first-person shooter
                        Counter-Strike: Source, developed by
                        Valve. Global Offensive's development began when Hidden Path Entertainment attempted to port
                        Counter-Strike: Source onto
                        video game consoles. During its development, Valve saw the opportunity to turn the port into a
                        full game and
                        expand on the predecessor's gameplay. Global Offensive began development in March 2010, and was
                        revealed to the public
                        on August 12, 2011. The closed beta started on November 30, 2011, and was initially restricted
                        to around ten
                        thousand people who received a key at events intended to showcase Global Offensive. After issues
                        with client and server
                        stability were addressed, the beta was opened up to progressively more people, and at E3 2012,
                        Valve announced that
                        Global Offensive would be released on August 21, 2012, with the open beta starting roughly a
                        month before that.
                        Before the public beta, Valve invited professional Counter-Strike players to play-test the game
                        and give feedback.

                        There were plans for cross-platform multiplayer play between Windows, OS X, Linux, Xbox 360, and
                        PlayStation 3 players,
                        but this was ultimately dropped so that the PC and Mac versions could be actively updated. On
                        August 21, 2012, the
                        game was publicly released on all platforms except Linux, which would not be released until
                        September 23, 2014.</p>

                    <p>Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based,

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>Counter-Strike 2 was developed with the Source 2 game engine as an update to Counter-Strike:
                        Global Offensive (2012),
                        and various aspects of Global Offensive were updated to use the features of the engine. It is
                        the first entry in the
                        Counter-Strike series in over ten years. In addition to the engine changes, the game was
                        developed alongside new
                        server architecture, allowing for "sub-tick" gameplay that more accurately synchronizes with
                        player input. New
                        gameplay mechanics include volumetric "smoke physics", a feature where the smoke generated by a
                        smoke grenade grows to
                        fill spaces, and can be altered in real time through hand grenades or gunshots.

                        Many maps from Global Offensive were given upgrades to take advantage of the features of Source
                        2, including new
                        lighting and enhanced textures. Valve created three different groups to place maps into
                        when reconstructing
                        them: "Touchstone" for maps that were unchanged in layout (ex. Dust II), "Upgrades" for maps
                        given large-scale graphical
                        upgrades with the features of Source 2 (ex. Nuke), and "Overhauls" for maps reconstructed from
                        the ground up (ex.
                        Inferno). Additionally, all cosmetic items from Global Offensive, including weapon
                        skins, knives, and gloves,
                        were transferred to Counter-Strike 2.</p>
